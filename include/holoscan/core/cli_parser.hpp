/**
 * @brief CLI Parser class.
 *
 * This class is used to parse the command line arguments. It uses CLI11 library internally.
 *
 * The application binary (in C++) or the Python script (in Python) can be executed with various
 * command-line options to run the App Driver and/or the App Worker:
 *
 * - `--driver`: Run the App Driver on the current machine. Can be used together with the `--worker`
 * option to run both the App Driver and the App Worker on the same machine.
 * - `--worker`: Run the App Worker.
 * - `--address`: The address (`[<IPv4 address or hostname>][:<port>]`) of the App Driver. If not
 * specified, the App Driver uses the default host address (0.0.0.0) with the default port number
 * (57777).
 * - `--worker-address`: The address (`[<IP or hostname>][:<port>]`) of the App Worker. If
 * not specified, the App Worker uses the default host address (0.0.0.0) with a randomly chosen port
 * number between 10000 and 32767 that is not currently in use.
 * - `--fragments`: The comma-separated names of the fragments to be executed by the App Worker. If
 * not specified, only one fragment (selected by the App Driver) will be executed. `all` can be used
 * to run all the fragments.
 * - `--config`: The path to the configuration file. This will override the configuration file path
 * configured in the application code (before run() is called).
 *
 * If neither `--driver` nor `--worker` is specified, the application will run the application
 * without the App Driver and the App Worker, as if the application were running in the single-node
 * without network communication. Connections between fragments are replaced with the standard
 * intra-fragment connections (double-buffered transmitter/receiver) used for operators.
