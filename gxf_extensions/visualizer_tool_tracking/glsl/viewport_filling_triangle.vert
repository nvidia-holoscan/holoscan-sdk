           This vertex shader is used for rendering a single fullscreen
           covering triangle. The vertex position in clip space and
           2D texture coordinates are computed from the vertex id.

           Vertex ID   |   Vertex Pos  |  Texture Coords
           ----------------------------------------------
                0      |    [-1, -1]   |   [ 0,  0 ]
                1      |    [ 3, -1]   |   [ 2,  0 ]
                2      |    [-1,  3]   |   [ 0, -2 ]

           The triangle fully covers the clip space region and creates
           fragments with vertex positions in the range [-1, 1] and
           texture coordinates in the range X: [0, 1], Y: [0, -1].
           Please note that for display of surgical video the texture
           coordinates y - component is flipped.

           The main benefit of using this shader is that no vertex and
           vertex attribute buffers are required. Only a single call to
           glDrawArrays to render one triangle is needed.
