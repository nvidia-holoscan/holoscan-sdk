# GPU Resident Input Example

This example demonstrates GPU-resident operators with a data ready handler for external sensor inputs. A registered data ready handler could be executed in the GPU itself.

## Overview

The example creates a GPU-resident pipeline that processes data generated by a separate data ready handler fragment. It includes:

- **SourceGpuOp**: A GPU-resident operator with an output port
- **ComputeGpuOp**: Operators that launch CUDA kernels to add 5 to each array element
- **SinkGpuOp**: Verifies results using a CUDA kernel

Data Ready Handler Fragment operator:
- **InputGpuOp**: A data ready handler that generates input data on the GPU and signals input data readiness

## Key Features

- **Data Ready Handler**: Demonstrates how to integrate external input sources with GPU-resident execution
- **CUDA Kernels**: All computation and verification happens on the GPU through custom CUDA kernels
- **Device Memory Management**: Shows proper use of device memory ports between GPU-resident operators
